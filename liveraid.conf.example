# Name must be unique; dir is the root path for that drive.

data 2 /mnt/disk2/
data 3 /mnt/disk3/

# Parity files: "parity LEVEL PATH"
# Level 1 = can recover 1 failed drive
# Level 2 = can recover 2 failed drives, etc. (up to 6)
# Levels must be contiguous starting from 1.

# Drive selection policy for new files:
#   mostfree   - pick the drive with the most free space (default)
#   lfs        - pick the drive with the least free space (fill fullest drive first)
#   pfrd       - weighted random: probability proportional to free space
#   roundrobin - cycle through drives in config order

# Number of threads used to drain the dirty-parity bitmap in parallel (default 1)
# Each thread handles an independent subset of dirty positions.
# Set to match the number of data drives or available CPU cores, whichever is smaller.
